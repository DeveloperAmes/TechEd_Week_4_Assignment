Got stuck for a really long time on not being able to send my submitted form data to my database. It was a syntax error in the end.

Had another issue with wrangling the data from the user base and then i not being defined in the for loop. It took a lot of console logging and debugging to figure out the issue but I managed to successfully render my comments onto my page using a for loop.

I wanted to try and add something to the date visited input where you cannot put future dates in it can only be up to the current date or previous. I tried using the max property and obtained the current date from JavaScript but it was still submitting the form if I had entered a future date.

I originally wanted to display the reviews in a carousel format so that it only showed one review at a time and I could set a timer so that it displayed another review in a set amount of time. I thought I would be able to do this, but sadly I think this was a bit too ambitious for me (since I couldn't do it before with my image gallery). I tried to follow the instructions on W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp), but got stuck with the JavaScript and how to implement this into my function. Instead, I decided to just display the 5 most recent reviews. Maybe (if I have time to), I can figure out how to make a "See all" button to display all reviews...
