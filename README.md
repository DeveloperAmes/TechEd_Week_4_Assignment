Got stuck for a really long time on not being able to send my submitted form data to my database. It was a syntax error in the end.

Had another issue with wrangling the data from the user base and then i not being defined in the for loop. It took a lot of console logging and debugging to figure out the issue but I managed to successfully render my comments onto my page using a for loop.
